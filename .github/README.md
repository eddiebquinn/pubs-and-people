# Pubs and people
I play Dungeons and Dragons with a group of friends most weeks - In one of these sessions our party was forced to essentially sit and wait for a long period of time in order to take a long rest. My character in this scenaro chose to fill the time by getting out the D&D players handbook, so we could pretend to play D&D inside D&D. Instead the party created a fake game called Pubs-and-People, where your D&D characters role play the person playing them (pressumably inside the pub).

This game is not meant to be taken seriously, it isn't really even meant to make sens - I am predominatley sharing this in the hopes it makes someone laugh.
