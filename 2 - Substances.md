# Part 2: Substance abuse and Ciroc
Substances in the game refer to any consumable items that can affect the player's character in some way, either positively or negatively. The most common types of substances in the game are alcohol and drugs. The substances mechanic adds an additional layer of realism and complexity to the game, allowing players to experience the effects of different types of substances on their characters.

In the game, substances can be consumed at the pub, where players can choose from a variety of drinks and other items that can provide a temporary boost to their character's abilities. However, substances can also have negative effects, such as reducing the character's coordination, causing them to lose focus, or making them sick.

## Alchohol
When a person consumes alcohol in the game, they can gain temporary buffs and debuffs based on the amount and type of alcohol they consume. Different types of alcohol have different effects. For example, beer might increase a character's health and reduce their accuracy, while a shot of whiskey might increase their attack power but decrease their defense.However, drinking too much alcohol can lead to negative consequences, such as impaired vision, reduced movement speed, and decreased accuracy. In extreme cases, a character can even become incapacitated or pass out, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.
