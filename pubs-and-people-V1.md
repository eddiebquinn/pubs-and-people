# Introduction
The Pubs and People RPG is is about storying telling in worlds of people and pubs. It share elements with adult games and night-out-on-the-town-with-the-boyz. Simmilar to those games this is driven by imagination - It's about picturing the twoering stein glass beneith an oddly we paper coaster (odd you donn't seem to ever remember using it, so how could it be wet?)

In the People and Pubs game, you create a person. It has been theorised by many people that we live inside another game very simmilar to Pubs and People, called Dungeons and Dragons; the same people has extrapolated this theory out to say that subconciously the characters we play in People & Pubs are the the people controlling us in Dungeons and Dragons. Here at Sorcerers of the Seaside we adimantly refuse this assertion, stating that this is a rumour created by a previous member Oregano because he left the party before he ever got the chance to take part in the million-gold-peice enterprise that is Sorcers of the Seasonside ltd. Your person is meant to team up with other people in the pub, inside the pubs and people peoples pub, and work together to play the people inside the pub inside the pubs and people RPG.

```
WARNING: Character inside People-and-Pubs have been known to become sentient and create their own RPG is left unattended for long periods of time, this is highly dicouraged. 
```

There is another character inside the pubs and peoples peoples pubs, and this is the landlord of the people inside the pubs and peopless pub. The pub-landlord is diesigned to design the night out. The lordland might might desicribe their entrance into the Golden Lion pub, inside a vilianous den called Romford, amoung other scenarios. Because the LL can improvise or react to anything the peoples pubs peoples, people and pubs is infinaltey flexible, and each night out can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end - When one night out ends, another one can begin, you can possiblky even carry the adventure on into the day, however this is likley end up up with your characters devloping an alchohol addiction. This will gradually eat away at their sanity stat over a lord period of time. This is a child friendly game and we do not wan't to encourage this behaviour. You cannot win this game, when alhohol is involved you only loose, and for this reason with every copy of the People-and-Pubs payers handbook we include a couon for a local 10-step program.

# Part 1: Creting a Person
Your first step in your People-and-Pubs aventure is to make the person who will drink in the pub. A character is a combination of game stats, roleplaying hooks =1~~, and subliminal messages from the person controlling you~~. You may be tempted to put thought into what kind of character you wantto be, or hes/her backstory - Dont

## Choose a persona
Every P&P character belongs to a race, these races include
	- Chav
	- Goth
	- Retired old man
	- Working man
	- Drunk college girl
	- Furry
	- Polish man

```
Please note: A controversy has be raise over the use of gendered terms inside the race names in People and Pubs potential Peoples personas inside the P&P pubs. We would like to make it clear that it is very possible to be a female Polish man.

### Chav

**Fake Gucci Flip-Flop**
Chavs are a halfling speciies inside the P&P pub, know their use of broken common-tounge and use of counterfeit garments. They typicall range between 5'5" and 5'9", and give off a feint odour of amber leaf. The chav has no unifying phsyical traits, just reemember if they are being obnosvious and seem to have a rudimentray mastery of the common tounge, they are likley a chav.
