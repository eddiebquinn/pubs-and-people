# Part 1: Creting a Person
Your first step in your People-and-Pubs aventure is to make the person who will drink in the pub. A character is a combination of game stats, roleplaying hooks =1~~, and subliminal messages from the person controlling you~~. You may be tempted to put thought into what kind of character you wantto be, or hes/her backstory - Dont

## Choose a persona
Every P&P character belongs to a race, these races include
	- Chav
	- Goth
	- Retired old man
	- Working man
	- Drunk college girl
	- Furry
	- Polish man

```
Please note: A controversy has be raise over the use of gendered terms inside the race names in People and Pubs potential Peoples personas inside the P&P pubs. We would like to make it clear that it is very possible to be a female Polish man.

### Chav

**Fake Gucci Flip-Flop**
Chavs are a halfling speciies inside the P&P pub, know their use of broken common-tounge and use of counterfeit garments. They typicall range between 5'5" and 5'9", and give off a feint odour of amber leaf. The chav has no unifying phsyical traits, just reemember if they are being obnosvious and seem to have a rudimentray mastery of the common tounge, they are likley a chav.
