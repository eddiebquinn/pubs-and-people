# Part 1: Creting a Person
Your first step in your People-and-Pubs aventure is to make the person who will drink in the pub. A character is a combination of game stats, roleplaying hooks =1~~, and subliminal messages from the person controlling you~~. You may be tempted to put thought into what kind of character you wantto be, or hes/her backstory - Dont

## Choose a persona
Every P&P character belongs to a race, these races include
	- Chav

Please note: A controversy has be raise over the use of gendered terms inside the race names in People and Pubs potential Peoples personas inside the P&P pubs. We would like to make it clear that it is very possible to be a female Polish man.
